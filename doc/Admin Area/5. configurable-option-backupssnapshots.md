### Price definitions

In this part of the settings, we define individual price lists for selected individual options.

We use the WHMCS standard and add the sign "|" to describe the individual options. The convention presented in our guide must be followed on the left side of the sign. To the right of the sign "|" we give the name that will be displayed in the views for the user (admin, client)

>It is very important to enter the names of the options precisely, because they are also used to define the settings and any mistakes or typos will prevent the correct operation of the entire ordering process and starting the virtual machine.

### Backup definitions

Add an option with a choice of the number of backups

### Option name

Option Name: **B|Backup**

You can replace the name "**Backup**" with your own, ie: Sicherung, My backup offer etc..

You can replace the name "name" with your own.
