### On the page with backup management

The client gets the opportunity to manage backups of his virtual machine.  
There is a schedule option to automatically create spare copies.

Clint is given the ability to create delete backups. It also provides the ability to restore a virtual machine from a backup.

>**By default, the schedule is not configured and no copies are made.** *The client must configure the schedule itself.* The time indicated in the schedule is generated automatically based on the analysis of the system load and is not subject to customer modifications.
