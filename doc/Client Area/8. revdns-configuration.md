On the configuration page of the reverse DNS zone, the client has the opportunity to set the domain name for the IP address of his virtual machine.

Currently, the module does not support the automatic update of revDNS, but supports the creation of requests with a request to update this setting by a specialist responsible for it in the company. You can set this option **'Revdns ticket/RevDNS ticket department'** during product configuration.
