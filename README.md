## Proxmox KVM WHMCS Module

The PUQ Proxmox KVM module for WHMCS provides automated provisioning, management, and billing of KVM virtual machines on Proxmox VE clusters. The module consists of two parts: the **Server Module** that handles VM provisioning and the client/admin interface, and the **Addon Module** that manages IP address pools, DNS zones, cron tasks, and provides a centralized management dashboard.

The module allows your customers to provision and manage KVM machines on your Proxmox server or Proxmox cluster. It exposes virtually all functions of Proxmox directly from the WHMCS panel without forcing the user (or admin) to log in to Proxmox itself. This greatly simplifies customer account management, improves customer satisfaction and reduces the number of support requests.

The module is intended for advanced users — installation and correct configuration require knowledge and experience in server and network administration. Although the documentation is detailed and allows the module to be installed by an intermediate user, we strongly suggest following the order defined in the installation chapter.

> **Changed in v3.0.** Starting from v3.0 the module ships its own dedicated addon module (`puq_proxmox_kvm`) — the separate **PUQ Customization** addon required for v1.3–v2.x is **no longer needed**. On first activation the new addon automatically migrates IP pools, DNS zones and VM records from the old `puq_customization` tables.

> **New in v3.3.** Full WHMCS Configurable Options coverage — 18 distinct options with clean plain-English names cover every per-service customisation (CPU, RAM, every disk size / bandwidth / IOPS, network bandwidth, IP counts, OS, backups, snapshots). Every option has a sensible default in Module Settings so products work out of the box. Disk downgrades are blocked by a three-layer safety net; selecting `Additional Disk = 0` cleanly removes the extra disk. See the [Changelog](02-changelog.md) and the [Configurable Options chapter](05-admin-area/03-configurable-options.md) for details.

> **New in v4.0.** Dual-mode snapshot system (scheduled automatic snapshots with automated FIFO rotation or lifetime cleanup), streamlined client area interface matching backups, modernized usage charts, ionCube 15 support, and comprehensive multi-language translations across 25 languages.

### Installation service

If you don't feel comfortable performing the installation yourself, PUQcloud offers an installation service in two variants — **module installation and configuration** and **full implementation**. See [puqcloud.com](https://puqcloud.com/whmcs-module-proxmox-kvm.php) for details.
